# **FARM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM [Discontinued]**

## Project Summary
This project is a farm management system that keeps track of many farming utilities and processes such as facilities, fields, animals, crops, farmers, products, and buyers, with the intention of helping farm owners manage their farms more efficiently and effectively.

The main aspects of the system are separated between staff, livestock, agriculture and the many components that are required to mass produce these items. All of these many entities will be linked to provide a user interface for the farmer in order to keep track of tasks needing to be accomplished, which include those listed above, in addition to keeping track of expenses and profits.

Furthermore, important distributors will also have access to the system in order to purchase products to distribute to other manufacturers, which implies a needed access to the database in order to view available products.

**Note:** Certain credential files have been removed from this repository, making it non-executable for local demonstrations. This repository is intended for reference purposes only.
